# Hello!

Some time ago i've been using the OxygenXML program for developing of technical documents.

And i had scenarios when i need to convert DITA files into PDF with brandbook styles.

So, now i push some of those files in public and you can use them for transformation of your own DITA through Oxy and Apache fop to PDF.

You are allowed to clone my repo and changes css-files as you need.
